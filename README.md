# RSVP
#####This is a RSVP app I built while learning from Team Treehouse React by Example tutorial

### Landing Page
###### Users can add the names of guests invited to their function and check the confirmed button which allows them filter guests if they have RSVP'd. 
##### Users can edit the guests, as well as remove them
##### As a name is being typed, a "ghost" tile appears
